# 3D printed Robotic Arm!
At [_Imperial Advanced Hackspace_](https://imperialhackspace.com/the-hackspace/), we were tasked in developing a **3D printed robotic arm** from scratch! Brainstorming the designs, modelling on [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/solutions/what-is-fusion-360) and building the code functionality. It was a rapid prototyping journey that headed towards an inter-course competition at the end of Spring term 2024.

## Key Thoughts and Resources
Using online arm calculator to consider max weight  
Using existing models to take inspiration  
Using ball bearings for improved rigidity but provide frictionless movement
